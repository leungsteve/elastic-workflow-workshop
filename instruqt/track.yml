title: Review Bomb Detection with Elastic Workflows
teaser: Learn to detect and respond to coordinated review attacks using ES|QL, Workflows, and Agent Builder
description: |
  In this hands-on workshop, you'll build an automated detection and response system
  to protect businesses from coordinated "review bomb" attacks.

  You'll learn how to:
  - Write detection queries using ES|QL and LOOKUP JOIN
  - Build automated workflows for real-time response
  - Create investigation tools with Agent Builder
  - Run an end-to-end attack simulation

  This workshop demonstrates patterns applicable to fraud detection, security operations,
  and compliance monitoring.

          # Welcome to the Review Bomb Workshop!

          In this workshop, you'll learn how to detect and respond to
          coordinated "review bomb" attacks using Elastic's powerful
          data analysis and automation tools.

          ## What You'll Build
          - Detection queries with ES|QL
          - Automated response workflows
          - AI-powered investigation tools

          Let's get started!

          # Automation with Workflows

          Now that you understand the data, it's time to automate
          detection and response.

          You'll create a workflow that:
          - Runs on a schedule
          - Detects review bombs with ES|QL
          - Automatically responds to protect businesses

          # AI-Powered Investigation

          Automated detection is great, but analysts still need to
          investigate incidents.

          Agent Builder lets you create custom tools that the AI
          assistant can use to answer natural language questions
          about your data.

          # Putting It All Together

          Time for the grand finale! You'll:
          - Launch a simulated review bomb attack
          - Watch your workflow detect and respond
          - Investigate with Agent Builder
          - Resolve the incident

          This is what real-world protection looks like!
